# Ocean Tide Safety Analyzer

## Overview
The **Ocean Tide Safety Analyzer** is a web-based application designed to predict the risk level of sailing based on ocean tide patterns. By analyzing wave height, frequency, and wind speed, the app provides real-time risk assessments to help prevent ship accidents.

## Features
- 🌊 **Real-time Tide Analysis** – Uses ML-based models to predict sailing risk.
- 🚢 **Risk Warnings** – Displays risk levels: Low, Moderate, or High.
- 📊 **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple Gradio UI for easy interaction.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Inputs** – Accepts wave height, frequency, and wind speed as inputs.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs **wave height, frequency, and wind speed**.
2. The ML model analyzes the data and predicts the risk level.
3. The result is displayed as **Low Risk, Moderate Risk, or High Risk**.
4. The app provides recommendations based on the risk level.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install gradio tensorflow numpy
```

### Run the Application
```sh
python your_script.py
```

### Accessing the Web App
Once the script runs successfully, a **Gradio web interface** will be launched. Open the provided link in your browser.

## Usage
1. Enter ocean wave parameters.
2. Click "Analyze" to process the data.
3. View the predicted sailing risk and recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- 🌍 **Integration with Live Weather Data APIs**
- 📡 **Satellite-based Tide Monitoring**
- 🤖 **Advanced AI Models for Improved Predictions**
